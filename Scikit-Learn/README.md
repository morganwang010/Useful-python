## sklearn
* https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html
* The essential building blocks for ML

## auto-sklearn
* https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/
* `auto-sklearn` frees a machine learning user from algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning. It leverages recent advantages in Bayesian optimization, meta-learning and ensemble construction.
* `auto-sklearn` is completely automatic and black-box. It searches a vast space of models and constructs complex ensemles of high accuracy, taking a substantial amount of computation and time in the process. The goal of auto-sklearn is to build the best model possible given the data.

## scikit-multiflow - A machine learning package for streaming data in Python. 
* https://github.com/scikit-multiflow/scikit-multiflow
* Stream learning models are created incrementally and are updated continuously. They are suitable for big data applications where real-time response is vital.
