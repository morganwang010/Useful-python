## Fast.ai 
* Package [fastai](https://docs.fast.ai/) and [website](https://www.fast.ai/)
* Not supported on Mac (read the docs). Did run some of the examples but training was going to take hours on the Mac CPU vs minutes on a GPU, so Mac is not feasible.
* Note fastai2 has breaking changes from fastai1. The fastai repo now points to fastai2. Any issues `pip install fastai --upgrade`

## Course v4 and fastbook
* https://github.com/fastai/course-v4 material same as https://github.com/fastai/fastbook

## Ecosystem
* Visual UI adds a graphical interface to fastai allowing the user to quickly load, choose parameters, train and view results without the need to dig deep into the code -> https://github.com/asvcode/Vision_UI
* Equivalent to Tensorflow serving but simpler -> https://github.com/developmentseed/fastai-serving
