## Pytorch
* https://pytorch.org/
* Python, but also has a C++ interface
* PyTorch provides two high-level features: (1) Tensor computing (like NumPy) with strong acceleration via graphics processing units (GPU). (2) Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autodiff system
* There are two popular pytorch wrappers, fastai and pytorch-lightning

## pytorch-lightning
* https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning
* TLDR: Lightning is a way to organize your PyTorch code to decouple the science code from the engineering. It's more of a PyTorch style-guide than a framework. Cuts down boilerplate code.
