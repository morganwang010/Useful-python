## Air quality
I am particularly interested in air quality measurements. The typical challenge is to predict an air quality metric or index given a set of sensor readings.

## Datasets & Organisations
* **Open AQ** an organisation that aggregates Governmental air quality readings. [Website](https://openaq.org) and [dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/open-aq/datasets). AQ data is also available, along with weather and imagery data at the [WIFIRE API](https://wifire.ucsd.edu/data-api). There is also a [python API](https://github.com/dhhagan/py-openaq). [Data browser](https://dolugen.github.io/openaq-browser).
* **Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service** https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-impact-of-air-quality-on-death-rates/data
* **Air quality in Madrid** https://www.kaggle.com/decide-soluciones/air-quality-madrid

## Case studies
* **Predicting Air Pollution in Ulaanbaatar** [Series of articles on Medium exploring different techniques](https://medium.com/mongolian-data-stories/ulaanbaatar-air-pollution-part-1-35e17c83f70b)
