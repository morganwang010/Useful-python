* https://github.com/abewley/sort
* Sort consumes an array of bounding box detections with each detection being defined as box `[x1,y1,x2,y2,score]`
* Good description of use in [Detect and track baseball using Detectron2 object detection and SORT tracking](https://towardsdatascience.com/detect-and-track-baseball-using-detectron2-and-sort-6dd92a46e6f2)
* Use openCV or ffmpeg to extract frames from video
