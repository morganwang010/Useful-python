* Python wrapper -> https://github.com/madhawav/YOLO3-4-Py (first `xcode-select --install`) -> Getting error `Library not loaded: libdarknet.so`

##Â Tiny YOLOv3
We have a very small model as well for constrained environments, yolov3-tiny.

## Yolo with openCV
* [Call Yolo from CopenCV]()

## Yolo on pi
* Using pjreddie version (including yolov3-tiny) I hit [this issue](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/issues/823) - recommended to use [AlexeyAB version](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet)

## Yolo on Jetson Nano

## Yolo face

## Yolo vs others

```
    If I know I need to detect small objects and speed is not a concern, I tend to use Faster R-CNN.
    If speed is absolutely paramount, I use YOLO.
    If I need a middle ground, I tend to go with SSDs.
